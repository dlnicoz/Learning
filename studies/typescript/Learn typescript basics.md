### first of all typescript is scripting language built on top of JavaScript .

It means that every single code is written in typescript is valid for JavaScript .

its development tool we can say that , cause its help finding addressing error not in runtime but in compile time only that's magic moment here .

## Typescript benefits

- Static typing ( Type checking )
- Code completion 
- Refactoring
- Shorthand notations

## Static typing vs Dynamic typing

there is two typed of language **statically typed** and **dynamically typed**

- in static type we can only use one datatype which is firstly declared like int number = 10; but we cant do number = "a" for example - C++ , C# , java
- in dynamic type we can change its datatype again and again like int number = 10 ; then number="a" it valid code example  - JavaScript , Python , Ruby

## Drawbacks

- Compilation - our browser don't understand typescript so .ts complier compile code into .js these process is known as transpiler.
- Discipline in coding - vanilla JavaScript can create nasty error by time its good for small project but for medium and large projects always prefer typescript .
