## react native for mobile apps #starter

- react native allows to build mobile apps for both android and IOS using JavaScript . 

- most of business logic and state management and general UI components can be shared across android and IOS 

> you can write a single codebase for both Android and iOS using React Native, and it works well for most use cases. However, it’s not a perfect "write once, run anywhere" solution.

For highly complex or performance-critical apps, fully native development might be a better choice
